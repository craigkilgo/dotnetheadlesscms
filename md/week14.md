## Week 14 Recap

### Playoffs

Team Woodward ended up being the only team without a Game of Thrones name to make it into the playoffs!

**The first week of the playoffs will see:**

Team Woodward vs. Winter is Here

BURN THEM ALL vs. I Drink And I Know Things

Reminder:  The winner of the loser's bracket also gets their entry fee back.  So set those lineups to win!

**Consolation Ladder:**

Team YoKilgo vs BREAKA MENISCUS

Tired Momma vs. Suwanee Falcon Folly

### Winter is Here vs. BURN THEM ALL

BURN THEM ALL put on a show in the final week of the regular season and gave Winter another loss in order to assure herself a spot in the playoffs.  It really never looked in doubt with Winter just failing to put up points in the early game.  No Gronk gave the Pats a loss and seemingly affected Winter QB Alex Smith somehow...

The real story was on the other side of the ball though, even though Carson Wentz went down, the Mad Queen can sub in Drew Brees.  Even the BURN THEM ALL bench went nuts with Buck Allen and Jamaal Williams combining for 40.

Winter is Here has to find a way to pull things together next week facing a red hot Team Woodward.  BURN THEM ALL will square off against the regular season titan I Drink And I Know Things.

### U TOUCHA SHIRT, BREAKA MENISCUS vs. Team YoKilgo

Early in the season this was a matchup of the bottom two teams.  In Week 14, YoKilgo had life and a clear path to playoffs.  Even though he took care of business against BREAKA MENISCUS in a tough matchup, BURN THEM ALL couldn't be caught in total wins and YoKilgo's magical run falls 1 game short.  These two Matts will immediately play a rematch in the first game of the consolation ladder.

### I Drink And I Know Things vs. Suwanee Falcon Folly

Suwanee Falcon Folly really wanted to avoid being the 8 seed, and went out and got a win against the top team in the league despite still starting a guy on IR in the TE spot and Matty Ice failing to get to double digits.

### Team Woodward vs. Tired Momma

Team Woodward had a less than 1% chance of missing the playoffs, but wanted to leave nothing to chance.  His team is firing on all cylinders right now and gave Tired Momma no chance whatsoever to move into the 5 seed going into the consolation ladder.   Four Woodward players crested the 20 point mark and even the bench had some 15+ players.  Lots of firepower will be coming at Winter trying to keep those cold winds at bay in the first round of the playoffs.
