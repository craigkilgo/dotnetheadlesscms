# Week 8 Recap

Three weeks ago YoKilgo was winless.  After this week, YoKilgo is 2 games back of a playoff spot.  Even this late, there are still lots of permutations of playoff spots available.

### Winter is Here vs. Team YoKilgo

Speaking of YoKilgo, it didn't take a 140+ point jailbreak for him to easily defeat Winter this week.  Winter's WB, Defense, and Kicker were the only players in double figures.  The Bucs offense looks like a summertime dumpster just before trash day and the Chiefs went from being the best team in the league to exceedingly mediocre.

The good news for YoKilgo is he got the win.  The bad news is it FINALLY looks like Zeke is gonna serve his 6 game suspension.  Russell Wilson put up 27 in game that the Seahawks got dominated in (like a reverse Drew Brees performance).  Zeke gave YoKilgo a nice going away performance to put him over the top.

### Suwanee Falcon Folly vs. Team Woodward

Team Woodward really didn't want to leave anything in the hands of fate after the previous week.  Tyrod Taylor was the next man up and chipped in 30 points early to set the tone.  McCaffrey finally got a rushing touchdown, and almost everyone on the roster got past 10 points.  A slick Kenyan Drake pickup after the Jay Ajai trade could end up being a difference maker down the stretch.

On the other side of the ball, things continue to deteriorate for Falcon Folly, really matching the real life Falcons.  Jonathan Stewart was worth -1.9.  Devonta turned in only 6 along with a pedestrian 22 from Matty Ice.  TY Hilton bounced back from his embarrassing performance the week before with 29.  Poor coaching starting 2 on a bye all but sealed the fate of Falcon Folly.

### U TOUCHA SHIRT, BREAKA MENISCUS vs. BURN THEM ALL

BREAKA MENISCUS finally catches a break with a win in the closest game of the week.  The Packers put up little fight against the Lions, letting Stafford accumulate 26.  Known puncher of women Joe Mixon fought his way to double digits along with Golden Tate and the BREAKA kicker and defense.  No points left on the bench meant he squeezed every point he could out of his roster this week.

Meanwhile, Drew Brees continues to put up modest point totals while Carson Wentz is agitating for that starting job.  Buck Allen on the bench also ended up being a difference maker as BURN THEM ALL fell less than 2 points short of a W.

### I Drink And I Know Things vs. Tired Momma

Tired Momma put up a noble effort with 5 players and 4 starters on a bye this week, but an Eli Manning led fantasy team is always trouble.  Eli at least found his way into double digits, not something that running backs CJ Anderson and Aaron Jones could say as they combined for 3.3 points.

Unfortunately for Tired Momma, the effort was all for naught as Drink and Know Things put up another stellar performance.  The lone coaching mistake was playing Doug Martin, a member of the aforementioned terrible Buccaneers instead of new Eagle Jay Ajai.  All of that meager Eli Manning output was nearly matched by Giants TE Evan Engram and Kamara starts to fulfill his promise putting up 25. Tyreek Hill seems like the only Chief who hasn't seen his production drop off over this recent 5 game downturn.  Drink and Know Things did huge damage to the points gap and is gunning for that #1 overall seed.

###This coming week will see:

Woodward looking to stay hot against suddenly vulnerable Winter is Here.
